I got this recipe for marinated portobello
mushroom steaks from Colleen Patrick-Goudreau's

2
00:00:06,729 --> 00:00:12,380
30-Day Vegan Challenge book and I've actually
cut the recipe in half. But, you'll probably

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,910
want to double it since each person should
actually get 2 mushrooms.

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,630
You could use this marinade for vegetables
and mushrooms and grill them in the summer.

5
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:28,449
They'd be perfect on a wrap, in a salad or
even just by themselves. I can't wait to find

6
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:34,730
out what you guys do with this recipe. Let
me know in the comments!

7
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:41,730
I'm using 6 portobello mushrooms and removing
the gills. This is actually optional. Make

8
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:48,890
sure you remove the stems as well and wipe
the tops of the mushrooms.

9
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:55,890
In a bowl, combine ¼ cup balsamic vinegar,
¼ cup soy sauce, ¼ cup of water and ½ teaspoon

10
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:05,930
each of dried rosemary, dried thyme, and dried
oregano. You're gonna also need ⅛ teaspoon

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,430
of black pepper.
Whisk that all together and you're going to

12
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:22,000
pour it over your mushrooms and marinate thems
for at least 30 minutes.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,040
After 30 minutes, heat some oil in a pan on
medium heat. Add as many mushrooms that will

14
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:35,040
fit in the pan with their tops down. Cook
them for about 3-5 minutes on each side, then

15
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:42,299
pour in some of the marinade.
Cover them and cook them for 10 minutes, and

16
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,479
make sure you just turn them halfway through.
Repeat this for the remaining mushrooms and

17
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,500
you're all done.
Portobello mushrooms have such a nice texture

18
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,049
and this marinade is awesome. You could do
so much with these mushrooms and the marinade.

19
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,400

00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:45,308
To GraÃ§a Machel and the Mandela family;

11
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:51,100
To President Zuma and members of the government;

12
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,357
to heads of states and goverments

13
00:00:54,357 --> 00:00:57,275
-- past and present --

14
00:00:57,275 --> 00:01:00,194
distinguished guests.

15
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:05,139
It is a singular honor to be with you today

16
00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:09,539
to celebrate a life like no other

17
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:13,580
To the people of South Africa

18
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:22,629
[cheers]

19
00:01:22,907 --> 00:01:28,490
People of every race and every walk of life

20
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:35,257
the world thanks you 
for sharing Nelson Mandela with us

21
00:01:35,565 --> 00:01:39,548
His struggle was your struggle

22
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:44,258
his triumph was your triumph,

23
00:01:44,643 --> 00:01:46,676
your dignity and your hope

24
00:01:46,676 --> 00:01:48,709
found expression in his life and your freedom

25
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:53,793
Your democracy

26
00:01:53,793 --> 00:01:57,604
it's his cherished legacy

27
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:03,583
It is hard to eulogize any man

28
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:07,153
to capture in words

29
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:13,152
not just the facts and the dates that make a life

30
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:17,027
but the essential truth of a person

31
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:20,853
the private joys and sorrows

32
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:24,068
the quiet moments and uniue qualities

33
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:27,746
that illuminate someone's soul

34
00:02:28,654 --> 00:02:32,409
How much harder to do so for a giant of history

35
00:02:32,594 --> 00:02:35,463
who moved a nation towards justice

36
00:02:35,463 --> 00:02:41,202
and in the process moved billions around the world

37
00:02:41,926 --> 00:02:44,154
Born during the World War I

38
00:02:44,154 --> 00:02:47,005
fired from court orders of power

39
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:49,859
a boy raised herding cattle

40
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:53,713
and tutored by the elders of his Mambu tribe

41
00:02:53,713 --> 00:03:00,599
Madiba would emerge 
as the last great liberator of the 20th century.

42
00:03:01,045 --> 00:03:05,009
Like Gandhi, he would lead a resistence movement

43
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:10,823
a movement 
that at the start had little prospect for success

44
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:14,996
Like Dr. King, he would give potent voice

45
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:17,592
to the claims of the oppressed

46
00:03:17,592 --> 00:03:21,856
and the moral necessity of racial justice

47
00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:25,643
He would endure a brutal imprisonment

48
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:30,450
that began in the time of Kennedy and Khrushchev

49
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,816
and reached the final days of the Cold War

50
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,261
Emerging from prison without the force of arms

51
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,548
he would -- like Abraham Lincoln --

52
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:41,680
hold his country together

53
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,122
when it threaten to break apart

54
00:03:45,384 --> 00:03:48,805
and like America's founding fathers he would erect

55
00:03:48,805 --> 00:03:54,761
a constitutional order 
to preserve freedom for future generations

56
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:59,358
A commitment to democracy and rule of law

57
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:02,093
ratified not only by his election

58
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:08,142
but by his willingness to step down from power 
after only one term

59
00:04:15,178 --> 00:04:18,825
Given the sweep of his life

60
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:22,561
the scope of his accomplishments

61
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:26,315
the adoration that he so rightly earned

62
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:30,165
it's tempting -- I think --
to remember Nelson Mandela as an icon

63
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:33,389
smilling and serene

64
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,313
detached from the tawdry affairs of lesser men

65
00:04:37,313 --> 00:04:40,743
but Madiba himself strongly resisted

66
00:04:40,743 --> 00:04:43,387
such a lifeless portrait

67
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:54,077
[cheers]

68
00:04:54,077 --> 00:04:55,400
Instead,

69
00:04:55,753 --> 00:05:01,277
Madiba insisted on sharing with us 
his doubts and his fears

70
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:06,763
his miscalculations along with his victories

71
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:08,931
"I am not a saint", he said

72
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:15,578
"unless you think of a saint 
as a sinner who keeps on trying."

73
00:05:16,747 --> 00:05:21,724
It was precisely 
because he could admit to imperfection

74
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:25,765
because he could be so full of good humour

75
00:05:25,765 --> 00:05:29,972
even mischief, 
despite the heavy burdens that he carried

76
00:05:29,972 --> 00:05:32,245
that we loved him so.

77
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,745
He was not a bust made of marble, 
he was a man of flesh and blood

78
00:05:37,745 --> 00:05:40,209
a son and a husband

79
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,943
a father and a friend

80
00:05:43,174 --> 00:05:46,770
and that's why we learned so much from him

81
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,432
and that's why we can learn from him still

82
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,899
For nothing he achieved was inevitable

83
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:56,178
in the arch of his life we see a man

84
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:59,511
who earned his place in history through struggle

85
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:03,600
and shrewdness and persistance and faith

86
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:08,064
he tells us what is possible

87
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:11,192
not just in the pages of history books

88
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:14,043
but in our own lives as well.

89
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,348
Mandela showed us the power of action

90
00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:25,442
of taking risks on behalf of our ideas

91
00:06:25,442 --> 00:06:30,682
Perhaps Mandela was right 
that he "inherited a proud rebelliousness

92
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:34,799
a stubborn sense of fairness&quot; from his father

93
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:39,812
and we know he shared 
with millions of black and coloured Southafricans

94
00:06:39,812 --> 00:06:42,687
&quot;the anger born of a thousand slights

95
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,775
a thousand indignities

96
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:48,863
a thousand unremembered moments

97
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:51,952
a desire to fight the system that imprisoned

98
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:54,447
my people&quot;, he said

99
00:06:55,432 --> 00:06:59,101
But like other early giants of the ANC

100
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:02,026
the Zulus and the Tambos,

101
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:08,342
[cheers]

102
00:07:08,342 --> 00:07:11,298
Madiba disciplined his anger

103
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:15,688
and channelled his desire to fight into organization

104
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:20,174
and platforms and strategies for action

105
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:23,162
so men and women could stand up

106
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:26,054
for the God given dignity

107
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:30,941
Moreover, he accepted the consequences 
of his actions

108
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:37,258
knowing that standing up 
to powerful interests and injustice carries a price

109
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:44,104
"I've fought against white domination
I've fought against black domination."

110
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:46,182
[cheers]

111
00:07:46,182 --> 00:07:51,078
"I've cherished the ideal of a democratic 
and free society

112
00:07:51,078 --> 00:07:54,061
in which all persons live together in harmony 
and equal opportunities

113
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:59,759
it is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve

114
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,445
but if needs be it's an ideal 
for which I am prepared to die."

115
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:15,185
[cheers]

116
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:17,889
Mandela taught us the power of action

117
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:21,904
but he also taught us the power of ideas

118
00:08:21,904 --> 00:08:25,773
the importance of reason and arguments

119
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:28,927
the need to study not only those who you agree with

120
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:32,566
but also those you don't agree with.

121
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:37,391
He understood that ideas cannot be contained by prison walls

122
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:41,182
or extinguished by a sniper's bullet

123
00:08:41,182 --> 00:08:44,556
He turned his trial into an indictment of apartheid

124
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:47,162
because of his eloquence and his passion

125
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:50,462
but also because of his training as an advocate

126
00:08:50,786 --> 00:08:55,048
He used decades of prison to sharpen his arguments

127
00:08:55,048 --> 00:09:00,705
but also to spread his thirst for knowledge 
to others in the movement

128
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:04,218
and he learned the language 
and the customs of his oppresors

129
00:09:04,218 --> 00:09:07,019
so that one day he might better convey to them

130
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,124
how their own freedom depend upon his.

131
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:17,361
[cheers]

132
00:09:17,747 --> 00:09:23,809
Mandela has demonstrated 
that action and ideas are not enough

133
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:25,447
no matter how right

134
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:30,971
they must also be ciselled in the laws and institutions

135
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:34,744
He was practical, testing his beliefs

136
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:39,791
against the hard surface of circumstance and history

137
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,934
On core principles he was unyielding

138
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:46,343
which is why he could rebuff offers 
of unconditional release

139
00:09:46,343 --> 00:09:49,073
reminding the aparthaid regime

140
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:53,235
that &quot;prisoners cannot enter into contracts.&quot;

141
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,551
But as he showed in painstaking negotiations

142
00:09:56,551 --> 00:10:00,147
to transfer power and draft new laws

143
00:10:00,147 --> 00:10:06,543
He was not afraid to compromise for the sake of a larger goal

144
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:10,342
And because he was not only a leader of a movement 
but a skilful politician

145
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:16,730
the constitution that emerged was worthy 
of this multi-racial democracy

146
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,977
true to his vision of laws to protect minority

147
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:28,067
as well as majority rights 
and the precious freedom of every Southafrican

148
00:10:29,283 --> 00:10:32,271
And finally Mandela uderstood

149
00:10:32,271 --> 00:10:36,043
the ties that bind the human spirit.

150
00:10:36,874 --> 00:10:40,620
There is a word in Southafrican

151
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:42,134
Ubuntu

152
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:48,423
[cheers]

153
00:10:48,654 --> 00:10:53,830
A word that captures Mandela's greatest gift:

154
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,895
his recognition that we are all bound together in ways

155
00:10:57,895 --> 00:11:00,557
that are invisible to the eye

156
00:11:00,557 --> 00:11:03,690
that there is a oneness to humanity

157
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,042
that we achieve ourselves 
by sharing ourselves with others

158
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:11,723
and caring for those around us

159
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,262
We can never know 
how much of this sense was innate in him

160
00:11:16,262 --> 00:11:22,298
or how much was shaped in a dark and solitary cell.

161
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:27,935
But we remember the gestures -- large and small --

162
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:32,902
introducing his jailers as honored guests 
at an inauguration;

163
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:37,757
taking a pitch in a springbok uniform;

164
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:43,688
turning his family's heartbreak into a call 
to confront HIV-AIDS

165
00:11:43,765 --> 00:11:49,367
that reveal the depths of his empathy 
and his understanding

166
00:11:49,598 --> 00:11:53,389
He not only embodied ubuntu he taught millions

167
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:56,973
to find that truth within themselves.

168
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,055
It took a man like Madiba to free

169
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:03,931
not just the prisoner but the jailer as well

170
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:06,527
[cheers]

171
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,374
to show that you must trust

172
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:11,906
others so that they may trust you

173
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:17,187
to teach that reconciliation is not a matter 
of ignoring a cruel past

174
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:25,577
but a means of confronting it 
with inclusion and generosity and truth

175
00:12:25,854 --> 00:12:28,521
He changed laws

176
00:12:28,521 --> 00:12:32,219
but he also changed hearts

177
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:36,910
For the people of South Africa

178
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:41,864
for those he inspired around the globe

179
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:46,079
Madiba's passing is rightly a time of mourning

180
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,612
and a time to celebrate a heroic life

181
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:54,588
But I believe it should also prompt in each of us

182
00:12:54,588 --> 00:12:58,595
a time for self-reflection with honesty

183
00:12:58,595 --> 00:13:02,557
regardless of our station or circumstance

184
00:13:02,557 --> 00:13:05,014
we must ask: "How well have I applied

185
00:13:05,014 --> 00:13:08,321
his lessons in my own life?&quot;

186
00:13:12,348 --> 00:13:15,232
It's a question I ask myself

187
00:13:15,232 --> 00:13:18,972
as a man and as a president

188
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,178
We know that white South Africa

189
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:28,207
the United States had overcome 
centuries of racial subjugation

190
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,607
As was true here, it took sacrifice

191
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:33,621
the sacrifices of countless people

192
00:13:33,621 --> 00:13:36,221
-- known and unknown --

193
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:39,363
to see the dawn of a new day

194
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,999
Michelle and I are beneficiaries of that struggle

195
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:46,937
[cheers]

196
00:13:46,937 --> 00:13:54,104
But in America and in South Africa 
and in countries all around the globe

197
00:13:54,104 --> 00:13:57,273
we cannot allow our progress to cloud the fact

198
00:13:57,273 --> 00:14:00,946
that our work is not yet done

199
00:14:02,146 --> 00:14:06,811
The struggles that follow 
the victory of formal equality

200
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:12,447
or universal franchise 
may not be as filled with drama and moral clarity

201
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:13,959
as those that came before

202
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:16,380
but they are not less important

203
00:14:17,011 --> 00:14:19,293
For around the world today

204
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:24,022
we still see children 
suffering from hunger and disease

205
00:14:24,022 --> 00:14:26,997
we still see run down schools

206
00:14:26,997 --> 00:14:31,605
we still see young people 
without prospects for the future.

207
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,449
Around the world today

208
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:37,014
men and women are still imprisoned 
for their political beliefs

209
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:39,946
and are still persecuted for what they look like

210
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,518
and how they worship, and who they love

211
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:44,767
and that is happening today

212
00:14:45,074 --> 00:14:50,899
[cheers]

213
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:56,799
And so we, too, must act on behalf of justice

214
00:14:57,046 --> 00:15:00,956
We, too, must act on behalf of peace

215
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:04,274
There are too many people who happily embrace

216
00:15:04,274 --> 00:15:07,712
Madiba's legacy of racial reconciliation

217
00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:11,445
but passionately resist even modest reforms.

218
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:16,936
that would challange chronic property 
and growing inequality

219
00:15:17,213 --> 00:15:20,340
There are too many leaders who claim solidarity

220
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,321
with Madiba's struggle for freedom

221
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,948
but do not tolerate the same for their own people

222
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:32,863
[cheers]

223
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,698
And there are too many of us

224
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:38,485
too many of us on the side lines

225
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:42,519
comfortable in complacency or cynicism

226
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,758
when our voices must be heard

227
00:15:47,082 --> 00:15:50,091
The questions we face today

228
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:54,024
how to promote equality and justice;

229
00:15:54,024 --> 00:15:57,622
how to uphold freedom and human rights;

230
00:15:57,622 --> 00:16:01,123
how to end a conflict and sectarian war

231
00:16:01,123 --> 00:16:05,040
these things do not have easy answers

232
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,833
But there were no easy answers

233
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:13,156
in front of that child born in World War I

234
00:16:13,156 --> 00:16:15,133
Nelson Mandela reminds us that

235
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:19,611
it always seems impossible until it is done

236
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,824
South Africa shows that it is true

237
00:16:22,824 --> 00:16:26,275
South Africa shows we can change

238
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:29,736
that we can choose a world 
defined not by our differences

239
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:31,768
but by our common hopes

240
00:16:31,768 --> 00:16:35,002
we can choose a world defined not by conflict

241
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:39,216
but by peace and justice and opportunity

242
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:45,109
[cheers]

243
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:47,725
We will never see

244
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:51,945
the likes of Nelson Mandela again

245
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:55,633
But let me say that the young people of Africa

246
00:16:55,633 --> 00:17:00,358
and the young people around the world

247
00:17:00,358 --> 00:17:05,013
you, too, can make his life's work your own

248
00:17:06,198 --> 00:17:10,415
Over thirty years ago, while still a student

249
00:17:10,415 --> 00:17:13,943
I learned of Nelson Mandela

250
00:17:13,943 --> 00:17:18,523
and the struggles taking place in this beautiful land

251
00:17:18,523 --> 00:17:21,606
and it stirred something in me

252
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,769
it woke me up to my responsibilities

253
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:27,246
-- to others and to myself --

254
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:30,309
and set me on an improbable journey

255
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:33,081
that finds me here today

256
00:17:34,897 --> 00:17:39,156
and while I will always fall short of Madiba's example

257
00:17:39,156 --> 00:17:42,692
he makes me want to be a better man

258
00:17:42,692 --> 00:17:44,449
[cheers]

259
00:17:44,449 --> 00:17:46,243
He speaks

260
00:17:46,243 --> 00:17:49,124
to what is best inside us

261
00:17:51,448 --> 00:17:55,252
After this great liberator is laid to rest

262
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:59,716
and when we return to our cities and villages

263
00:17:59,716 --> 00:18:03,558
and rejoined our daily routines

264
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:06,924
let us search for his strength

265
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:11,157
let us search for his largeness of spirit

266
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:15,394
somewhere inside of ourselves

267
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,565
and when the night grows dark

268
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:22,243
when injustice weights heavy on our hearts

269
00:18:22,243 --> 00:18:26,572
when our best laid plans seem beyond our reach

270
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,305
let us think of Madiba

271
00:18:29,305 --> 00:18:32,736
and the words that brought him comfort

272
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:36,167
within the 4 walls of his cell:

273
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:39,599
&quot;It matters not how streight the gate,

274
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:45,232
how charged the punishment the scroll

275
00:18:45,232 --> 00:18:48,356
I am the master of my fate,

276
00:18:48,356 --> 00:18:51,397
I am the captain of my soul.&quot;

277
00:18:52,228 --> 00:18:55,034
What a magnificent soul it was

278
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:57,519
We will miss him deeply

279
00:18:58,073 --> 00:19:00,830
May God bless the memory of Nelson Mandela.

280
00:19:01,091 --> 00:19:04,786
May God bless the people of South Africa

281
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:16,906
[cheers]

1
00:00:03,377 --> 00:00:04,681
For the past five years,

2
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:05,815
I've been investigating this question

3
00:00:05,815 --> 00:00:07,756
of where good ideas come from.

4
00:00:07,903 --> 00:00:09,601
It's a kind of problem, I think,

5
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:11,203
all of us are intrinsically interested in.

6
00:00:11,894 --> 00:00:13,498
We want to be more creative.

7
00:00:13,498 --> 00:00:15,023
We want to come up with better ideas.

8
00:00:15,023 --> 00:00:17,604
We want our organisations to be more innovative.

9
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:21,320
I've looked at this problem from an environmental perspective.

10
00:00:22,108 --> 00:00:26,989
What are the spaces that have historically lead to unusual rates of creativity and innovation?

11
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:32,905
And what I've found, in all this systems, there are these recurring patterns, that you see

12
00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:34,403
again and again,

13
00:00:34,428 --> 00:00:36,981
that are crucial to creating environments that are unusually innovative.

14
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,431
One pattern, I call the "slow hunch".

15
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,816
That breakthrough ideas almost never come in a moment of great insight.

16
00:00:44,517 --> 00:00:45,730
In a sudden stroke of inspiration.

17
00:00:46,686 --> 00:00:49,285
Most important ideas take a long time to evolve

18
00:00:50,022 --> 00:00:51,670
and they spend a long time dormant,

19
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:53,197
in the background.

20
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:55,776
It isn't until the ideas have two or three years,

21
00:00:55,776 --> 00:00:58,193
sometimes ten or twenty years, to mature

22
00:00:58,193 --> 00:01:00,488
that it suddenly becomes acessible to you,

23
00:01:00,605 --> 00:01:02,558
and useful to you, in a certain way.

24
00:01:03,014 --> 00:01:05,450
And this is, partially, because good ideas

25
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,541
come from the collision between smaller hunches,

26
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,113
so that they form something bigger than themselves.

27
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:13,603
So you see a lot, in the history of innovation,

28
00:01:13,603 --> 00:01:16,824
cases of someone who has half of an idea.

29
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:18,774
There's a great story about the invention

30
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:20,632
of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee.

31
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:24,126
This is a project that Berners-Lee worked on for ten years.

32
00:01:24,573 --> 00:01:28,958
But when he started, he didn't have a full vision of this new medium he was going to invent.

33
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:33,278
He started working on one project, as a side-project to help him organize his own data.

34
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:35,904
He scrapped that after a couple of years,

35
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:37,443
and he started working on another thing.

36
00:01:37,443 --> 00:01:41,130
And only after about ten years to the full vision of the web come into being

37
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,597
That is, more often that not,

38
00:01:43,597 --> 00:01:44,820
how ideas happen.

39
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,820
They need time to incubate.

40
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:49,985
And they spend a lot of time in this 'partial hunch' form.

41
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,349
The other thing that's important,

42
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:53,686
when you think about ideas this way,

43
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:56,183
is that when ideas take form in this 'hunch' state,

44
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,739
they need to collide with other hunches.

45
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:03,683
Often times, the thing that turns a hunch in a real breakthrough is another hunch

46
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:06,065
that's lurking in someboby else's mind.

47
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:08,583
And you have to figure out a way to create systems

48
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:12,734
that allow those hunches to come together and turn into something bigger

49
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:14,274
than the sum of their parts.

50
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:17,660
That's why, for instance, the Coffee House in the age of the Enlightenment

51
00:02:17,975 --> 00:02:20,783
Or the Parisian Salons of Modernism, were such engines of creativity.

52
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:25,466
Because they created a space where ideas could mingle

53
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,605
and swap

54
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:27,116
and create new forms.

55
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:33,320
When you look at the problem of innovation from this perspective,

56
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:36,783
it sheds a lot of important light on a debate we've been having recently

57
00:02:37,084 --> 00:02:39,304
about what the Internet is doing to our brains.

58
00:02:39,803 --> 00:02:43,430
Are we getting overwhelmed with an always connected, multi-tasking lifestyle?

59
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:46,427
And is this gonna lead to less sophisticated thoughts

60
00:02:46,802 --> 00:02:49,825
as we move away from the slower, deeper, contemplative

61
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:50,431
state of reading, for instance?

62
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:54,271
Obviously, I'm a big fan of reading!

63
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:56,726
But I think it's important to remember that

64
00:02:56,726 --> 00:03:01,352
the great driver of scientific innovation -- and technological innovation-- has been the

65
00:03:01,352 --> 00:03:04,103
historic increase of connectivity.

66
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,868
And our ability to reach out and exchange ideas with other people.

67
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:10,243
And to borrow other people's hunches

68
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:12,130
and combine them with our hunches

69
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,110
and turn them into something new.

70
00:03:14,763 --> 00:03:19,161
That really has, I think, been --more than anything else-- the primary engine

71
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:22,573
of creativity and innovation over the last 600 or 700 years.

72
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,797
And so, yes, it's true we're more distracted.

73
00:03:26,214 --> 00:03:30,767
But what has happened, that is really miraculous and marvelous, over the last fifteen years

74
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:33,513
is that we have so many ways to connect.

75
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:36,985
And so many new ways to reach out and find other people

76
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,941
who have that missing piece that will complete the idea we're working on.

77
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:42,683
Or to stumble serendipitously across some amazing

78
00:03:42,683 --> 00:03:45,200
new piece of information that we can use to build

79
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,102
and improve our own ideas.

80
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:49,569
That's the real lesson.

81
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:51,243
of where good ideas come from:

82
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:53,733
That chance favours the connected mind!

1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,529
The rights of citizens

2
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:17,652
the future of the Internet.

3
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:21,404
So I would like to welcome to the TED stage

4
00:00:21,404 --> 00:00:25,321
the man behind those revelations, Ed Snowden.

5
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:29,776
(Applause)

6
00:00:29,776 --> 00:00:33,835
Ed is in a remote location somewhere in Russia

7
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:36,736
controlling this bot from his laptop,

8
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:40,666
so he can see what the bot can see.

9
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,675
Ed, welcome to the TED stage.

10
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:46,138
What can you see, as a matter of fact?

11
00:00:46,138 --> 00:00:47,928
Ha, I can see everyone.

12
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:50,323
This is amazing.

13
00:00:50,323 --> 00:00:53,528
(Laughter)

14
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:56,811
Ed, some questions for you.

15
00:00:56,811 --> 00:00:59,696
You've been called many things in the last few months.

16
00:00:59,696 --> 00:01:02,896
You've been called a whistleblower,

17
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,445
a traitor

18
00:01:04,445 --> 00:01:06,479
, a hero.

19
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,062
What words would you describe yourself with?

20
00:01:10,062 --> 00:01:14,303
You know, everybody who is involved with this debate

21
00:01:14,303 --> 00:01:16,762
has been struggling over me and my personality

22
00:01:16,762 --> 00:01:20,113
and how to describe me.

23
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,107
But when I think about it,

24
00:01:22,107 --> 00:01:25,202
this isn't the question that we should be struggling with.

25
00:01:25,202 --> 00:01:28,361
Who I am really doesn't matter at all.

26
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:30,733
If I'm the worst person in the world,

27
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:33,105
you can hate me and move on.

28
00:01:33,105 --> 00:01:35,478
What really matters here are the issues.

29
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:38,312
What really matters here is the kind of government we want,

30
00:01:38,312 --> 00:01:40,391
the kind of Internet we want,

31
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:44,118
the kind of relationship between people and societies.

32
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:46,973
And that's what I'm hoping the debate will move towards,

33
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,716
and we've seen that increasing over time.

34
00:01:48,716 --> 00:01:51,246
If I had to describe myself,

35
00:01:51,246 --> 00:01:55,058
I wouldn't use words like "hero." I wouldn't use "patriot," and I wouldn't use "traitor.

36
00:01:55,058 --> 00:01:56,650
" I'd say I'm an American

37
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,806
and I'm a citizen, just like everyone else.

38
00:02:00,806 --> 00:02:03,681
So just to give some context for those who don't know the whole story

39
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:07,934
-- (Applause)

40
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:10,684
this time a year ago,

41
00:02:10,684 --> 00:02:14,683
you were stationed in Hawaii working as a consultant to the NSA.

42
00:02:14,683 --> 00:02:16,078
As a sysadmin

43
00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:19,440
, you had access to their systems,

44
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,489
and you began revealing certain classified documents to some handpicked journalists

45
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:28,183
leading the way to June's revelations.

46
00:02:28,183 --> 00:02:33,517
Now, what propelled you to do this?

47
00:02:33,517 --> 00:02:38,581
You know, when I was sitting in Hawaii,

48
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,351
and the years before, when I was working in the intelligence community,

49
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:45,101
I saw a lot of things that had disturbed me.

50
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:48,300
We do a lot of good things in the intelligence community,

51
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,099
things that need to be done, and things that help everyone.

52
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:54,050
But there are also things that go too far.

53
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,547
There are things that shouldn't be done

54
00:02:55,547 --> 00:02:58,760
, and decisions that were being made in secret

55
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,326
without the public's awareness, without the public's consent,

56
00:03:02,326 --> 00:03:08,745
and without even our representatives in government having knowledge of these programs.

57
00:03:08,745 --> 00:03:13,136
When I really came to struggle with these issues,

58
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:14,553
I thought to myself,

59
00:03:14,553 --> 00:03:17,845
how can I do this in the most responsible way,

60
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:20,475
that maximizes the public benefit

61
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:23,705
while minimizing the risks?

62
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:26,636
And out of all the solutions that I could come up with,

63
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:28,968
out of going to Congress,

64
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:33,718
when there were no laws, there were no legal protections for a private employee,

65
00:03:33,718 --> 00:03:37,347
a contractor in intelligence like myself,

66
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:40,861
there was a risk that I would be buried along with the information

67
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:42,614
and the public would never find out.

68
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:48,699
But the First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees us a free press for a reason,

69
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,243
and that's to enable an adversarial press,

70
00:03:52,243 --> 00:03:57,005
to challenge the government, but also to work together with the government,

71
00:03:57,005 --> 00:04:04,678
to have a dialogue and debate about how we can inform the public about matters of vital importance

72
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,763
without putting our national security at risk.

73
00:04:07,763 --> 00:04:09,428
And by working with journalists,

74
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:13,885
by giving all of my information back to the American people,

75
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:18,344
rather than trusting myself to make the decisions about publication,

76
00:04:18,344 --> 00:04:20,762
we've had a robust debate

77
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:23,978
with a deep investment by the government

78
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:29,013
that I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone.

79
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:32,812
And the risks that have been threatened,

80
00:04:32,812 --> 00:04:36,476
the risks that have been played up by the government

81
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,886
have never materialized.

82
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:39,939
We've never seen any evidence

83
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:43,647
of even a single instance of specific harm

84
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,179
, and because of that, I'm comfortable with the decisions that I made.

85
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:51,886
So let me show the audience a couple of examples of what you revealed.

86
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:53,678
If we could have a slide up, and Ed,

87
00:04:53,678 --> 00:04:56,512
I don't know whether you can see, the slides are here.

88
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:59,402
This is a slide of the PRISM program,

89
00:04:59,402 --> 00:05:04,235
and maybe you could tell the audience what that was that was revealed.

90
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:06,401
The best way to understand PRISM

91
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:07,980
because there's been a little bit of controversy,

92
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,714
is to first talk about what PRISM isn't.

93
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,512
Much of the debate in the U.S. has been about metadata.

94
00:05:14,512 --> 00:05:17,262
They've said it's just metadata, it's just metadata,

95
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:20,152
and they're talking about a specific legal authority

96
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:22,928
called Section 215 of the Patriot Act.

97
00:05:22,928 --> 00:05:26,678
That allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping, mass surveillance

98
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:30,220
of the entire country's phone records, things like that --

99
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,678
who you're talking to,

100
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:33,427
when you're talking to them,

101
00:05:33,427 --> 00:05:35,169
where you traveled.

102
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,568
These are all metadata events.

103
00:05:37,568 --> 00:05:40,803
PRISM is about content.

104
00:05:40,803 --> 00:05:45,302
It's a program through which the government could compel corporate America,

105
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:52,180
it could deputize corporate America to do its dirty work for the NSA.

106
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,552
And even though some of these companies did resist,

107
00:05:55,552 --> 00:05:59,402
even though some of them -- I believe Yahoo was one of them challenged them in court,

108
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:00,477
they all lost

109
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:03,788
, because it was never tried by an open court.

110
00:06:03,788 --> 00:06:06,817
They were only tried by a secret court.

111
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:08,067
And something that we've seen,

112
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,818
something about the PRISM program that's very concerning to me is,

113
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:13,568
there's been a talking point in the U.S. government where they've said

114
00:06:13,568 --> 00:06:19,178
15 federal judges have reviewed these programs and found them to be lawful,

115
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,735
but what they don't tell you

116
00:06:21,735 --> 00:06:26,595
is those are secret judges in a secret court

117
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,718
based on secret interpretations of law

118
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:36,234
that's considered 34,000 warrant requests over 33 years,

119
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:41,596
and in 33 years only rejected 11 government requests.

120
00:06:41,596 --> 00:06:44,317
These aren't the people that we want deciding

121
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:48,679
what the role of corporate America in a free and open Internet should be.

122
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:51,012
Now, this slide that we're showing here

123
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:55,568
shows the dates in which different technology companies, Internet companies,

124
00:06:55,568 --> 00:07:01,067
are alleged to have joined the program, and where data collection began from them.

125
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:05,636
Now, they have denied collaborating with the NSA.

126
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:10,594
How was that data collected by the NSA?

127
00:07:10,594 --> 00:07:16,818
Right. So the NSA's own slides refer to it as direct access.

128
00:07:16,818 --> 00:07:19,403
What that means to an actual NSA analyst,

129
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:23,803
someone like me who was working as an intelligence analyst targeting, you know

130
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:27,261
Chinese cyber-hackers, things like that, in Hawaii,

131
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:31,428
is the provenance of that data is directly from their servers.

132
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:33,388
It doesn't mean

133
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:38,427
that there's a group of company representatives sitting in a smoky room with the NSA

134
00:07:38,427 --> 00:07:42,969
palling around and making back-room deals about how they're going to give this stuff away.

135
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:45,263
Now each company handles it different ways.

136
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:46,302
Some are responsible.

137
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:48,110
Some are somewhat less responsible.

138
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:49,387
But the bottom line is,

139
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:53,651
when we talk about how this information is given,

140
00:07:53,651 --> 00:07:56,303
it's coming from the companies themselves.

141
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:58,734
It's not stolen from the lines.

142
00:07:58,734 --> 00:08:00,484
But there's an important thing to remember here:

143
00:08:00,484 --> 00:08:02,484
even though companies pushed back,

144
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:07,012
even though companies demanded, hey, let's do this through a warrant process,

145
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:11,762
let's do this where we actually have some sort of legal review,

146
00:08:11,762 --> 00:08:15,899
some sort of basis for handing over these users' data,

147
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:18,250
we saw stories in the Washington Post last year

148
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,193
that weren't as well reported as the PRISM story

149
00:08:21,193 --> 00:08:27,670
that said the NSA broke in to the data center communications between Google to itself

150
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,383
and Yahoo to itself.

151
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:32,267
So even these companies that are cooperating

152
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:37,100
in at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner with the NSA,

153
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,184
the NSA isn't satisfied with that,

154
00:08:40,184 --> 00:08:45,049
and because of that, we need our companies to work very hard

155
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:48,718
to guarantee that they're going to represent the interests of the user,

156
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:52,133
and also advocate for the rights of the users.

157
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,299
And I think over the last year,

158
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:58,182
we've seen the companies that are named on the PRISM slides take great strides to do that,

159
00:08:58,182 --> 00:09:00,467
and I encourage them to continue

160
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:03,300
What more should they do?

161
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:09,049
The biggest thing that an Internet company in America can do today,

162
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:14,884
right now, without consulting with lawyers, to protect the rights of users worldwide,

163
00:09:14,884 --> 00:09:22,267
is to enable SSL web encryption on every page you visit.

164
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:24,433
The reason this matters

165
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:30,475
is today, if you go to look at a copy of "1984" on Amazon.com,

166
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:32,807
the NSA can see a record of that

167
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:35,290
, the Russian intelligence service can see a record of that,

168
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,474
the Chinese service can see a record of that,

169
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:40,779
the French service, the German service, the services of Andorra.

170
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:43,946
They can all see it because it's unencrypted.

171
00:09:43,946 --> 00:09:47,612
The world's library is Amazon.com,

172
00:09:47,612 --> 00:09:50,264
but not only do they not support encryption by default,

173
00:09:50,264 --> 00:09:54,058
you cannot choose to use encryption when browsing through books.

174
00:09:54,058 --> 00:09:55,373
This is something that we need to change

175
00:09:55,373 --> 00:09:56,481
, not just for Amazon,

176
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:57,793
I don't mean to single them out,

177
00:09:57,793 --> 00:09:59,196
but they're a great example.

178
00:09:59,196 --> 00:10:04,225
All companies need to move to an encrypted browsing habit by default

179
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:09,112
for all users who haven't taken any action or picked any special methods on their own.

180
00:10:09,112 --> 00:10:13,976
That'll increase the privacy and the rights that people enjoy worldwide.

181
00:10:13,976 --> 00:10:16,181
Ed, come with me to this part of the stage.

182
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:18,332
I want to show you the next slide here.

183
00:10:18,332 --> 00:10:19,718
(Applause)

184
00:10:19,718 --> 00:10:22,318
This is a program called Boundless Informant.

185
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:23,719
What is that?

186
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:26,191
So, I've got to give credit to the NSA

187
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,777
for using appropriate names on this.

188
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:32,469
This is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms.

189
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:36,859
Boundless Informant is a program that the NSA hid from Congress.

190
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:39,051
The NSA was previously asked by Congress,

191
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:45,135
was there any ability that they had to even give a rough ballpark estimate

192
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:49,442
of the amount of American communications that were being intercepted.

193
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:50,860
They said no.

194
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,300
They said, we don't track those stats,

195
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,967
and we can't track those stats.

196
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:56,316
We can't tell you

197
00:10:56,316 --> 00:10:58,384
how many communications we're intercepting around the world,

198
00:10:58,384 --> 00:11:03,277
because to tell you that would be to invade your privacy.

199
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:05,634
Now, I really appreciate that sentiment from them,

200
00:11:05,634 --> 00:11:07,568
but the reality, when you look at this slide is,

201
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:09,391
not only do they have the capability,

202
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:11,889
the capability already exists.

203
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:13,597
It's already in place.

204
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:17,159
The NSA has its own internal data format

205
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:20,764
that tracks both ends of a communication,

206
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,014
and if it says,

207
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,182
this communication came from America,

208
00:11:24,182 --> 00:11:28,432
they can tell Congress how many of those communications they have today,

209
00:11:28,432 --> 00:11:29,263
right now.

210
00:11:29,263 --> 00:11:32,056
And what Boundless Informant tells us

211
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:36,904
is more communications are being intercepted in America

212
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:41,142
about Americans than there are in Russia about Russians.

213
00:11:41,142 --> 00:11:45,252
I'm not sure that's what an intelligence agency should be aiming for.

214
00:11:45,252 --> 00:11:47,834
Ed, there was a story broken in the Washington Post,

215
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:49,584
again from your data.

216
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,168
The headline says,

217
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:54,751
"NSA broke privacy rules thousands of times per year."

218
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,335
Tell us about that.

219
00:11:56,335 --> 00:11:58,834
We also heard in Congressional testimony last year,

220
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:02,918
it was an amazing thing for someone like me who came from the NSA

221
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:05,141
and who's seen the actual internal documents,

222
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,926
knows what's in them,

223
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:12,140
to see officials testifying under oath that there had been no abuses,

224
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,801
that there had been no violations of the NSA's rules,

225
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,719
when we knew this story was coming.

226
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:20,720
But what's especially interesting about this,

227
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,051
about the fact that the NSA has violated their own rules,

228
00:12:24,051 --> 00:12:27,847
their own laws thousands of times in a single year,

229
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,469
including one event by itself,

230
00:12:30,469 --> 00:12:35,440
one event out of those 2,776,

231
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,796
that affected more than 3,000 people.

232
00:12:37,796 --> 00:12:41,712
In another event, they intercepted all the calls in Washington, D.C.,

233
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:43,963
by accident.

234
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,047
What's amazing about this,

235
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:48,379
this report, that didn't get that much attention,

236
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:53,178
is the fact that not only were there 2,776 abuses,

237
00:12:53,178 --> 00:12:56,797
the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Dianne Feinstein,

238
00:12:56,797 --> 00:12:59,380
had not seen this report

239
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,843
until the Washington Post contacted her asking for comment on the report.

240
00:13:04,843 --> 00:13:08,212
And she then requested a copy from the NSA and received it,

241
00:13:08,212 --> 00:13:10,297
but had never seen this before that.

242
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:13,213
What does that say about the state of oversight

243
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:14,880
in American intelligence

244
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,797
when the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee

245
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:21,629
has no idea that the rules are being broken thousands of times every year?

246
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:25,962
Ed, one response to this whole debate is this:

247
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:29,426
Why should we care about all this surveillance, honestly?

248
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:31,862
I mean, look, if you've done nothing wrong

249
00:13:31,862 --> 00:13:34,298
, you've got nothing to worry about.

250
00:13:34,298 --> 00:13:36,734
What's wrong with that point of view?

251
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:38,300
Well, so the first thing is

252
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,217
, you're giving up your rights.

253
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:43,806
You're saying hey, you know, I don't think I'm going to need them,

254
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:45,476
so I'm just going to trust that, you know,

255
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:48,323
let's get rid of them, it doesn't really matter,

256
00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:50,551
these guys are going to do the right thing.

257
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:52,302
Your rights matter

258
00:13:52,302 --> 00:13:55,052
because you never know when you're going to need them.

259
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:57,301
Beyond that, it's a part of our cultural identity,

260
00:13:57,301 --> 00:13:59,605
not just in America,

261
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:03,968
but in Western societies and in democratic societies around the world.

262
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,520
People should be able to pick up the phone

263
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,852
and to call their family,

264
00:14:07,852 --> 00:14:11,019
people should be able to send a text message to their loved ones,

265
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:13,552
people should be able to buy a book online,

266
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,437
they should be able to travel by train,

267
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:21,105
they should be able to buy an airline ticket without wondering about how these events are going to look

268
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:27,311
to an agent of the government, possibly not even your government years in the future,

269
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:31,770
how they're going to be misinterpreted and what they're going to think your intentions were.

270
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,200
We have a right to privacy.

271
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,852
We require warrants to be based on probable cause

272
00:14:37,852 --> 00:14:40,187
or some kind of individualized suspicion

273
00:14:40,187 --> 00:14:44,500
because we recognize that trusting anybody,

274
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,219
any government authority,

275
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:50,052
with the entirety of human communications in secret

276
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:56,606
and without oversight is simply too great a temptation to be ignored.

277
00:14:56,606 --> 00:14:59,023
Some people are furious at what you've done.

278
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,200
I heard a quote recently from Dick Cheney

279
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,854
who said that Julian Assange was a flea bite,

280
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:11,469
Edward Snowden is the lion that bit the head off the dog.

281
00:15:11,469 --> 00:15:17,188
He thinks you've committed one of the worst acts of betrayal in American history.

282
00:15:17,188 --> 00:15:22,788
What would you say to people who think that?

283
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,128
Dick Cheney's really something else.

284
00:15:25,128 --> 00:15:27,013
(Laughter)

285
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:33,014
(Applause)

286
00:15:33,014 --> 00:15:34,373
Thank you.

287
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:37,678
(Laughter)

288
00:15:37,678 --> 00:15:38,298
I think it's amazing,

289
00:15:38,298 --> 00:15:43,627
because at the time Julian Assange was doing some of his greatest work,

290
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:48,480
Dick Cheney was saying he was going to end governments worldwide,

291
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,883
the skies were going to ignite

292
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,856
and the seas were going to boil off,

293
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:54,965
and now he's saying it's a flea bite.

294
00:15:54,965 --> 00:16:02,050
So we should be suspicious about the same sort of overblown claims of damage to national security

295
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,437
from these kind of officials.

296
00:16:03,437 --> 00:16:10,465
But let's assume that these people really believe this.

297
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:17,023
I would argue that they have kind of a narrow conception of national security.

298
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:20,274
The prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney

299
00:16:20,274 --> 00:16:23,480
do not keep the nation safe.

300
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,490
The public interest

301
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,688
is not always the same as the national interest.

302
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:33,633
Going to war with people who are not our enemy

303
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:37,881
in places that are not a threat doesn't make us safe,

304
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:41,311
and that applies whether it's in Iraq or on the Internet.

305
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:43,383
The Internet is not the enemy.

306
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:45,355
Our economy is not the enemy.

307
00:16:45,355 --> 00:16:47,716
American businesses, Chinese businesses,

308
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:52,298
and any other company out there

309
00:16:52,298 --> 00:16:54,631
is a part of our society.

310
00:16:54,631 --> 00:16:56,689
It's a part of our interconnected world.

311
00:16:56,689 --> 00:17:01,380
There are ties of fraternity that bond us together,

312
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,964
and if we destroy these bonds

313
00:17:03,964 --> 00:17:07,106
by undermining the standards, the security,

314
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:09,897
the manner of behavior,

315
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:15,466
that nations and citizens all around the world expect us to abide by.

316
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:21,106
But it's alleged that you've stolen 1.7 million documents.

317
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:25,465
It seems only a few hundred of them have been shared with journalists so far.

318
00:17:25,465 --> 00:17:28,775
Are there more revelations to come?

319
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:31,131
There are absolutely more revelations to come.

320
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:34,152
I don't think there's any question that

321
00:17:34,152 --> 00:17:39,526
some of the most important reporting to be done

322
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:42,812
is yet to come.

323
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,440
Come here, because

324
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,971
I want to ask you about this particular revelation.

325
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:49,398
Come and take a look at this.

326
00:17:49,398 --> 00:17:51,357
I mean, this is a story which

327
00:17:51,357 --> 00:17:54,475
I think for a lot of the techies in this room is the single most shocking thing

328
00:17:54,475 --> 00:17:56,772
that they have heard in the last few months.

329
00:17:56,772 --> 00:17:59,436
It's about a program called "Bullrun."

330
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:03,392
Can you explain what that is?

331
00:18:03,392 --> 00:18:04,355
So Bullrun,

332
00:18:04,355 --> 00:18:12,060
and this is again where we've got to thank the NSA for their candor,

333
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,058
this is a program named after a Civil War battle.

334
00:18:16,058 --> 00:18:18,356
The British counterpart is called Edgehill,

335
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:19,740
which is a U.K. civil war battle.

336
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,989
And the reason that I believe they're named this way

337
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:25,525
is because they target our own infrastructure.

338
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:28,073
They're programs through which the NSA

339
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:32,440
intentionally misleads corporate partners.

340
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,655
They tell corporate partners that these are safe standards.

341
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:41,524
They say hey, we need to work with you to secure your systems,

342
00:18:41,524 --> 00:18:42,941
but in reality,

343
00:18:42,941 --> 00:18:45,483
they're giving bad advice to these companies

344
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:48,274
that makes them degrade the security of their services.

345
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:53,108
They're building in backdoors that not only the NSA can exploit,

346
00:18:53,108 --> 00:18:57,690
but anyone else who has time and money to research and find it

347
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,603
can then use to let themselves in to the world's communications.

348
00:19:01,603 --> 00:19:03,663
And this is really dangerous,

349
00:19:03,663 --> 00:19:07,663
because if we lose a single standard,

350
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:10,520
if we lose the trust of something like SSL,

351
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,270
which was specifically targeted by the Bullrun program,

352
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,200
we will live a less safe world overall.

353
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,019
We won't be able to access our banks

354
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:24,227
and we won't be able to access commerce

355
00:19:24,227 --> 00:19:29,437
without worrying about people monitoring those communications or subverting them for their own ends.

356
00:19:29,437 --> 00:19:38,802
And do those same decisions also potentially open America up to cyberattacks from other sources?

357
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:41,819
Absolutely.

358
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:48,074
One of the problems, one of the dangerous legacies that we've seen in the post-9/11 era

359
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,673
, is that the NSA has traditionally worn two hats.

360
00:19:54,673 --> 00:19:56,632
They've been in charge of offensive operations,

361
00:19:56,632 --> 00:19:57,759
that is hacking,

362
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,437
but they've also been in charge of defensive operations,

363
00:20:00,437 --> 00:20:04,436
and traditionally they've always prioritized defense over offense

364
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:08,185
based on the principle that American secrets are simply worth more.

365
00:20:08,185 --> 00:20:12,049
If we hack a Chinese business and steal their secrets,

366
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:16,185
if we hack a government office in Berlin and steal their secrets,

367
00:20:16,185 --> 00:20:19,883
that has less value to the American people

368
00:20:19,883 --> 00:20:24,385
than making sure that the Chinese can't get access to our secrets.

369
00:20:24,385 --> 00:20:28,882
So by reducing the security of our communications,

370
00:20:28,882 --> 00:20:30,604
they're not only putting the world at risk,

371
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,021
they're putting America at risk in a fundamental way,

372
00:20:33,021 --> 00:20:37,631
because intellectual property is the basis, the foundation of our economy,

373
00:20:37,631 --> 00:20:39,840
and if we put that at risk through weak security,

374
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,591
we're going to be paying for it for years

375
00:20:41,591 --> 00:20:45,131
But they've made a calculation that it was worth doing this

376
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:48,687
as part of America's defense against terrorism.

377
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:52,631
Surely that makes it a price worth paying

378
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:58,716
Well, when you look at the results of these programs in stopping terrorism

379
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:02,176
, you will see that that's unfounded

380
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:04,020
, and you don't have to take my word for it,

381
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,966
because we've had the first open court,

382
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:13,134
the first federal court that's reviewed this, outside the secrecy arrangement,

383
00:21:13,134 --> 00:21:17,464
called these programs Orwellian and likely unconstitutional.

384
00:21:17,464 --> 00:21:21,384
Congress, who has access to be briefed on these things,

385
00:21:21,384 --> 00:21:24,632
and now has the desire to be,

386
00:21:24,632 --> 00:21:26,965
has produced bills to reform it,

387
00:21:26,965 --> 00:21:29,440
and two independent White House panels

388
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,977
who reviewed all of the classified evidence

389
00:21:31,977 --> 00:21:36,354
said these programs have never stopped a single terrorist attack

390
00:21:36,354 --> 00:21:39,216
that was imminent in the United States.

391
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:43,104
So is it really terrorism that we're stopping?

392
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:45,216
Do these programs have any value at all?

393
00:21:45,216 --> 00:21:46,300
I say no,

394
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,839
and all three branches of the American government say no as well.

395
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:55,175
I mean, do you think there's a deeper motivation for them than the war against terrorism?

396
00:21:55,175 --> 00:21:56,465
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you, say again?

397
00:21:56,465 --> 00:22:03,605
Sorry. Do you think there's a deeper motivation for them other than the war against terrorism?

398
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:05,255
Yeah. The bottom line

399
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:08,899
is that terrorism has always been what we in the intelligence world would call

400
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:11,548
a cover for action.

401
00:22:11,548 --> 00:22:14,714
Terrorism is something that provokes an emotional response

402
00:22:14,714 --> 00:22:22,570
that allows people to rationalize authorising powers and programs that they wouldn't give otherwise.

403
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,854
The Bullrun and Edgehill-type programs,

404
00:22:24,854 --> 00:22:28,603
the NSA asked for these authorities back in the 1990s.

405
00:22:28,603 --> 00:22:31,632
They asked the FBI to go to Congress and make the case.

406
00:22:31,632 --> 00:22:33,884
The FBI went to Congress and did make the case.

407
00:22:33,884 --> 00:22:36,687
But Congress and the American people said no.

408
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:38,758
They said, it's not worth the risk to our economy.

409
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:43,900
They said it's worth too much damage to our society to justify the gains.

410
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,605
But what we saw is, in the post-9/11 era

411
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:51,174
, they used secrecy and they used the justification of terrorism

412
00:22:51,174 --> 00:22:54,687
to start these programs in secret without asking Congress,

413
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:56,673
without asking the American people,

414
00:22:56,673 --> 00:22:59,464
and it's that kind of government behind closed doors

415
00:22:59,464 --> 00:23:01,936
that we need to guard ourselves against,

416
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:03,310
because it makes us less safe,

417
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,317
and it offers no value.

418
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:06,845
Okay, come with me here for a sec

419
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:09,241
, because I've got a more personal question for you.

420
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:12,382
Speaking of terror,

421
00:23:12,382 --> 00:23:18,676
most people would find the situation you're in right now in Russia pretty terrifying.

422
00:23:18,676 --> 00:23:23,132
You obviously heard what happened,

423
00:23:23,132 --> 00:23:25,262
what the treatment that Bradley Manning got,

424
00:23:25,262 --> 00:23:27,928
Chelsea Manning as now is,

425
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:33,923
and there was a story in Buzzfeed saying that there are people in the intelligence community who want you dead.

426
00:23:33,923 --> 00:23:35,777
How are you coping with this?

427
00:23:35,777 --> 00:23:38,800
How are you coping with the fear?

428
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:46,385
It's no mystery that there are governments out there that want to see me dead.

429
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:50,900
I've made clear again and again and again

430
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,093
that I go to sleep every morning

431
00:23:53,093 --> 00:23:57,884
thinking about what I can do for the American people.

432
00:23:57,884 --> 00:24:00,759
I don't want to harm my government.

433
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:03,969
I want to help my government,

434
00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:10,425
but the fact that they are willing to completely ignore due process,

435
00:24:10,425 --> 00:24:16,219
they're willing to declare guilt without ever seeing a trial,

436
00:24:16,219 --> 00:24:19,591
these are things that we need to work against as a society,

437
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:22,172
and say hey, this is not appropriate.

438
00:24:22,172 --> 00:24:23,964
We shouldn't be threatening dissidents.

439
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:27,910
We shouldn't be criminalizing journalism.

440
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,425
And whatever part I can do to see that end,

441
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:33,174
I'm happy to do despite the risks.

442
00:24:33,174 --> 00:24:36,259
So I'd actually like to get some feedback from the audience here,

443
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:40,341
because I know there's widely differing reactions to Edward Snowden.

444
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:42,841
Suppose you had the following two choices, right?

445
00:24:42,841 --> 00:24:47,390
You could view what he did as fundamentally a reckless act

446
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,918
that has endangered America

447
00:24:50,918 --> 00:24:57,424
or you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act that will work towards America

448
00:24:57,424 --> 00:24:59,259
and the world's long-term good?

449
00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:02,174
Those are the two choices I'll give you.

450
00:25:02,174 --> 00:25:06,049
I'm curious to see who's willing to vote with the first of those,

451
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:09,338
that this was a reckless act?

452
00:25:09,338 --> 00:25:11,129
There are some hands going up.

453
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:12,301
Some hands going up.

454
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:15,934
It's hard to put your hand up when the man is standing right here,

455
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:17,407
but I see them.

456
00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:18,634
I can see you.

457
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:20,174
(Laughter)

458
00:25:20,174 --> 00:25:22,410
And who goes with the second choice

459
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,646
, the fundamentally heroic act?

460
00:25:24,646 --> 00:25:26,884
(Applause) (Cheers)

461
00:25:26,884 --> 00:25:30,007
And I think it's true to say that there are a lot of people who didn't show a hand

462
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:33,132
and I think are still thinking this through,

463
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,673
because it seems to me

464
00:25:34,673 --> 00:25:39,924
that the debate around you doesn't split along traditional political lines.

465
00:25:39,924 --> 00:25:41,017
It's not left or right,

466
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:44,568
it's not really about pro-government, libertarian,

467
00:25:44,568 --> 00:25:46,890
or not just that.

468
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,801
Part of it is almost a generational issue

469
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:51,672
. You're part of a generation that grew up with the Internet,

470
00:25:51,672 --> 00:25:56,426
and it seems as if you become offended at almost a visceral level

471
00:25:56,426 --> 00:25:59,885
when you see something done that you think will harm the Internet.

472
00:25:59,885 --> 00:26:03,718
Is there some truth to that?

473
00:26:03,718 --> 00:26:08,634
It is. I think it's very true.

474
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:11,969
This is not a left or right issue.

475
00:26:11,969 --> 00:26:13,480
Our basic freedoms,

476
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,589
and when I say our,

477
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:15,896
I don't just mean Americans,

478
00:26:15,896 --> 00:26:18,008
I mean people around the world,

479
00:26:18,008 --> 00:26:20,173
it's not a partisan issue

480
00:26:20,173 --> 00:26:22,341
. These are things that all people believe,

481
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:24,884
and it's up to all of us to protect them,

482
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:29,341
and to people who have seen and enjoyed a free and open Internet,

483
00:26:29,341 --> 00:26:34,423
it's up to us to preserve that liberty for the next generation to enjoy,

484
00:26:34,423 --> 00:26:36,506
and if we don't change things,

485
00:26:36,506 --> 00:26:41,890
if we don't stand up to make the changes we need to do

486
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,673
to keep the Internet safe,

487
00:26:42,673 --> 00:26:45,839
not just for us but for everyone,

488
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:46,964
we're going to lose that,

489
00:26:46,964 --> 00:26:48,021
and that would be a tremendous loss

490
00:26:48,021 --> 00:26:50,558
, not just for us, but for the world.

491
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,674
Well, I have heard similar language recently from the founder of the world wide web

492
00:26:54,674 --> 00:26:57,434
, who I actually think is with us,

493
00:26:57,434 --> 00:26:58,975
Sir Tim Berners-Lee.

494
00:26:58,975 --> 00:27:01,634
Tim, actually, would you like to come up and say,

495
00:27:01,634 --> 00:27:03,589
do we have a microphone for Tim?

496
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:06,839
(Applause)

497
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,591
Tim, good to see you.

498
00:27:08,591 --> 00:27:12,091
Come up there.

499
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:15,384
Which camp are you in, by the way,

500
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:16,803
traitor, hero?

501
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,470
I have a theory on this, but --

502
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:23,423
I've given much longer answers to that question,

503
00:27:23,423 --> 00:27:24,678
but hero

504
00:27:24,678 --> 00:27:29,313
, if I have to make the choice between the two.

505
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:32,258
And Ed, I think you've read the proposal

506
00:27:32,258 --> 00:27:36,423
that Sir Tim has talked about about a new Magna Carta to take back the Internet.

507
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:38,675
Is that something that makes sense?

508
00:27:38,675 --> 00:27:41,261
Absolutely. I mean, my generation,

509
00:27:41,261 --> 00:27:44,214
I grew up not just thinking about the Internet,

510
00:27:44,214 --> 00:27:46,923
but I grew up in the Internet,

511
00:27:46,923 --> 00:27:52,921
and although I never expected to have the chance to defend it

512
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:58,714
in such a direct and practical manner and to embody it

513
00:27:58,714 --> 00:28:02,686
in this unusual, almost avatar manner,

514
00:28:02,686 --> 00:28:07,630
I think there's something poetic about the fact that one of the sons of the Internet

515
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:10,631
has actually become close to the Internet

516
00:28:10,631 --> 00:28:13,130
as a result of their political expression.

517
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:18,371
And I believe that a Magna Carta for the Internet is exactly what we need.

518
00:28:18,371 --> 00:28:21,860
We need to encode our values

519
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,714
not just in writing but in the structure of the Internet,

520
00:28:25,714 --> 00:28:27,881
and it's something that I hope,

521
00:28:27,881 --> 00:28:33,589
I invite everyone in the audience, not just here in Vancouver but around the world,

522
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:36,152
to join and participate in.

523
00:28:36,152 --> 00:28:38,944
Do you have a question for Ed?

524
00:28:38,944 --> 00:28:41,146
Well, two questions, a general question

525
00:28:41,146 --> 00:28:42,814
Ed, can you still hear us?

526
00:28:42,814 --> 00:28:43,961
Yes, I can hear you.

527
00:28:43,961 --> 00:28:46,396
Oh, he's back.

528
00:28:46,396 --> 00:28:51,193
The wiretap on your line got a little interfered with for a moment. (Laughter)

529
00:28:51,193 --> 00:28:53,978
It's a little bit of an NSA problem.

530
00:28:53,978 --> 00:29:00,771
So, from the 25 years, stepping back and thinking,

531
00:29:00,771 --> 00:29:03,469
what would you think would be the best

532
00:29:03,469 --> 00:29:09,750
that we could achieve from all the discussions that we have about the web we want?

533
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:16,468
When we think about in terms of how far we can go,

534
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:18,718
I think that's a question that's really only limited by

535
00:29:18,718 --> 00:29:20,983
what we're willing to put into it.

536
00:29:20,983 --> 00:29:26,207
I think the Internet that we've enjoyed in the past has been exactly what

537
00:29:26,301 --> 00:29:32,883
we as not just a nation but as a people around the world need,

538
00:29:32,883 --> 00:29:38,687
and by cooperating, by engaging not just the technical parts of society,

539
00:29:38,687 --> 00:29:41,086
but as you said, the users

540
00:29:41,086 --> 00:29:42,853
, the people around the world

541
00:29:42,853 --> 00:29:45,884
who contribute through the Internet, through social media,

542
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,403
who just check the weather,

543
00:29:47,403 --> 00:29:50,245
who rely on it every day as a part of their life

544
00:29:50,245 --> 00:29:53,104
, to champion that.

545
00:29:53,104 --> 00:29:58,633
We'll get not just the Internet we've had, but a better Internet, a better now,

546
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:02,885
something that we can use to build a future

547
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:05,552
that'll be better not just than what we hoped for

548
00:30:05,552 --> 00:30:07,856
but anything that we could have imagined.

549
00:30:07,856 --> 00:30:13,075
It's 30 years ago that TED was founded, 1984.

550
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:19,340
A lot of the conversation since then has been along the lines that actually George Orwell got it wrong.

551
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,971
It's not Big Brother watching us.

552
00:30:20,971 --> 00:30:23,184
We, through the power of the web, and transparency

553
00:30:23,184 --> 00:30:24,921
, are now watching Big Brother.

554
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:31,300
Your revelations kind of drove a stake through the heart of that rather optimistic view,

555
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,106
but you still believe

556
00:30:33,106 --> 00:30:36,770
there's a way of doing something about that

557
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:37,976
And you do too.

558
00:30:37,976 --> 00:30:39,404
Right, so

559
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:44,261
there is an argument to be made that

560
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:48,022
the powers of Big Brother have increased enormously.

561
00:30:48,022 --> 00:30:52,271
There was a recent legal article at Yale

562
00:30:52,271 --> 00:30:56,133
that established something called the Bankston-Soltani Principle,

563
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:59,635
which is that our expectation of privacy

564
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:03,107
is violated when the capabilities of government surveillance

565
00:31:03,107 --> 00:31:06,188
have become cheaper by an order of magnitude,

566
00:31:06,188 --> 00:31:07,522
and each time that occurs

567
00:31:07,522 --> 00:31:11,763
, we need to revisit and rebalance our privacy rights.

568
00:31:11,763 --> 00:31:13,217
Now, that hasn't happened

569
00:31:13,217 --> 00:31:19,022
since the government's surveillance powers have increased by several orders of magnitude,

570
00:31:19,022 --> 00:31:21,855
and that's why we're in the problem that we're in today,

571
00:31:21,855 --> 00:31:25,718
but there is still hope, because

572
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:30,134
the power of individuals have also been increased by technology.

573
00:31:30,134 --> 00:31:32,435
I am living proof

574
00:31:32,435 --> 00:31:38,782
that an individual can go head to head against the most powerful adversaries

575
00:31:38,782 --> 00:31:43,106
and the most powerful intelligence agencies around the world and win,

576
00:31:43,106 --> 00:31:47,051
and I think that's something that we need to take hope from,

577
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:49,384
and we need to build on to make it accessible

578
00:31:49,384 --> 00:31:53,189
not just to technical experts but to ordinary citizens around the world.

579
00:31:53,189 --> 00:31:56,633
Journalism is not a crime, communication is not a crime,

580
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:59,468
and we should not be monitored in our everyday activities.

581
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:02,384
I'm not quite sure how you shake the hand of a bot,

582
00:32:02,384 --> 00:32:08,189
but I imagine it's, this is the hand right here.

583
00:32:08,189 --> 00:32:09,275
Nice to meet you,

584
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:13,954
and I hope my beam looks as nice as my view of you guys does.

585
00:32:13,954 --> 00:32:16,416
Thank you, Tim.

586
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:22,150
(Applause)

587
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:26,250
I mean, The New York Times recently called for an amnesty for you.

588
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:30,290
Would you welcome the chance to come back to America?

589
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,217
Absolutely.

590
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:34,730
There's really no question,

591
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:39,356
the principles that have been the foundation of this project

592
00:32:39,356 --> 00:32:43,502
have been the public interest

593
00:32:43,502 --> 00:32:52,001
and the principles that underly the journalistic establishment in the United States and around the world,

594
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:57,064
and I think if the press is now saying,

595
00:32:57,064 --> 00:33:01,188
we support this, this is something that needed to happen,

596
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:02,019
that's a powerful argument

597
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:03,444
, but it's not the final argument,

598
00:33:03,444 --> 00:33:06,355
and I think that's something that public should decide.

599
00:33:06,355 --> 00:33:07,925
But at the same time,

600
00:33:07,925 --> 00:33:11,689
the government has hinted that they want some kind of deal,

601
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:16,106
that they want me to compromise the journalists with which I've been working,

602
00:33:16,106 --> 00:33:17,383
to come back

603
00:33:17,383 --> 00:33:20,228
, and I want to make it very clear that

604
00:33:20,228 --> 00:33:22,522
I did not do this to be safe.

605
00:33:22,522 --> 00:33:25,107
I did this to do what was right,

606
00:33:25,107 --> 00:33:29,856
and I'm not going to stop my work in the public interest just to benefit myself.

607
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:38,002
(Applause)

608
00:33:38,002 --> 00:33:42,759
In the meantime, courtesy of the Internet and this technology,

609
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,529
you're here, back in North America,

610
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:48,279
not quite the U.S., Canada, in this form.

611
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:53,397
I'm curious, how does that feel?

612
00:33:53,397 --> 00:33:55,561
Canada is different than what I expected.

613
00:33:55,561 --> 00:33:56,813
It's a lot warmer.

614
00:33:56,813 --> 00:34:03,220
(Laughter)

615
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,666
At TED, the mission is "ideas worth spreading."

616
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:08,897
If you could encapsulate it in a single idea,

617
00:34:08,897 --> 00:34:15,147
what is your idea worth spreading right now at this moment?

618
00:34:15,147 --> 00:34:18,899
I would say the last year has been a reminder that

619
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:22,314
democracy may die behind closed doors,

620
00:34:22,314 --> 00:34:26,899
but we as individuals are born behind those same closed doors,

621
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:32,397
and we don't have to give up our privacy to have good government.

622
00:34:32,397 --> 00:34:36,397
We don't have to give up our liberty to have security.

623
00:34:36,397 --> 00:34:39,116
And I think by working together

624
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:43,397
we can have both open government and private lives,

625
00:34:43,397 --> 00:34:45,891
and I look forward to working with everyone around the world

626
00:34:45,891 --> 00:34:47,630
to see that happen.

627
00:34:47,063 --> 00:34:50,826
Thank you very much.

628
00:34:50,826 --> 00:34:54,589
thank you.

629
00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:58,354
(Applause)

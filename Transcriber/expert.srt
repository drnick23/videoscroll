00:00:00,255 --> 00:00:03,336
Our company has a new strategic initiative

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:06,625
to increase market penetration, maximize brand loyalty,

3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:08,693
and enhance intangible assets.

4
00:00:08,693 --> 00:00:12,077
In pursuit of these objectives, we've started a new project

5
00:00:12,077 --> 00:00:14,673
for which we require seven red lines.

6
00:00:14,673 --> 00:00:16,776
I understand your company can help us in this matter.

7
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:20,564
Man: Of course. Walter here will be the project manager.

8
00:00:20,564 --> 00:00:24,071
Walter, we can do this, can't we?
Walter: Yes, of course.

9
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:27,606
Walter: Anderson here is our expert in all matters related to the drawing of red lines.

10
00:00:27,606 --> 00:00:30,059
We've brought him along today to share his professional opinion.

11
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:32,871
(Woman) Nice to meet you. Well, you all know me.

12
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:36,540
-This is Justine, our company's design specialist.
- Justine: Hello.

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,233
Woman: We need you to draw seven red lines all of them strictly perpendicular.

14
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:45,193
Some with green ink and some with transparent. Can you do that?

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,479
-Anderson: (pausing) No, I'm afraid we...
-Walter: Let's not rush into any hasty answers, Anderson.

16
00:00:49,518 --> 00:00:51,814
Walter: The task has been set and needs to be carried out.

17
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,968
At the end of the day, you are an expert.

18
00:00:53,995 --> 00:00:56,515
Anderson: The term "red line" implies the color of the line to be red.

19
00:00:56,635 --> 00:00:58,746
To draw a red line with green ink is,

20
00:00:58,847 --> 00:01:01,375
well, if it's not exactly impossible, it's pretty close to being impossible.

21
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:04,569
Walter: What does that even mean? "Impossible"

22
00:01:04,824 --> 00:01:06,045
-Women laughing
-Anderson: I mean it is possible there are some

23
00:01:06,243 --> 00:01:10,926
people suffering from colorblindness for whom the color blind doesn't really make a difference.

24
00:01:10,926 --> 00:01:13,399
But I'm quite sure that the target audience

25
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:16,003
of your project doesn't consist solely of such people.

26
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:18,035
Woman: So, in principle, this is possible.

27
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:23,942
Anderson: I'll simplify. Lines as such can be drawn with absolutely any ink.

28
00:01:24,153 --> 00:01:27,850
But if you want to get a red line, you need to use red ink.

29
00:01:27,997 --> 00:01:30,810
-Man: What if we draw them with blue ink? 
-Walter: Hmm. Hmm.

30
00:01:31,005 --> 00:01:34,702
Anderson: It still won't work. If you use blue ink, you'll get blue lines.

31
00:01:37,337 --> 00:01:40,727
And what exactly did you mean when you talked about the transparent ink?

32
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:43,699
Woman: How would I explain? I'm sure you know what

33
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:44,844
transparent means.

34
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:49,610
-Anderson: Yes, I do.
-Woman: And what a red line means. I hope I don't need to explain to you

35
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:51,238
(laughing)
-Anderson: Of course not.

36
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:55,404
Woman: Well. You need to draw a red line... with transparent ink.

37
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:59,140
Anderson: Could you describe what you imagine the end result would look like?

38
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,903
Walter: Oh come on, Anderson, what have we got here? Kindergarten.

39
00:02:01,073 --> 00:02:02,078
(all talking at once)

40
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:05,284
Man: Let's not waste our time with these unproductive quarrels.

41
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:08,633
The task has been set, the task is plain and clear.

42
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:11,788
Now, if you have any specific questions, then go ahead.

43
00:02:11,788 --> 00:02:14,106
Walter: You're the expert here.

44
00:02:14,744 --> 00:02:17,431
Anderson: Alright, let's leave aside the color for the moment.

45
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:20,692
You had something there also relating to perpendicularity.

46
00:02:20,692 --> 00:02:23,121
Woman: Seven lines. All strictly perpendicular.

47
00:02:23,121 --> 00:02:24,459
Anderson: To what?

48
00:02:25,056 --> 00:02:30,304
Woman: Uh... To everything... amongst themselves.

49
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:32,812
I assume you know what perpendicular lines are like?

50
00:02:33,162 --> 00:02:35,627
Walter: Of course he does. He's an expert.

51
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:40,704
Anderson: Two lines can be perpendicular. All seven can't be simultaneously perpendicular to each other.

52
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,987
I'll, I'll show you!

53
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:48,744
This is a line. Right?

54
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:50,533
Woman: Yes.

55
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:55,142
Anderson: And another. Is it perpendicular to the first line?

56
00:02:56,282 --> 00:02:59,826
-Woman: Well...
-Anderson: Yes! It is perpendicular.

57
00:02:59,832 --> 00:03:02,718
-Woman: Exactly. Yes.
-Anderson: Wait, wait I'm not done.

58
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,131
And a third one. Is it perpendicular to the first line?

59
00:03:06,847 --> 00:03:10,444
Yes it is. But it doesn't cross the second line.

60
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,460
They're both parallel. Not perpendicular.

61
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,920
Woman: Ah. Suppose so. 
Anderson: There it is. Two lines can be perpendicular...

62
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,454
Woman: Can I have the pen?
(drawing noises)

63
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:45,994
How bout this?

64
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:54,557
Anderson: This is a triangle. It's definitely not perpendicular lines.

65
00:03:54,557 --> 00:03:58,588
And there are three, not seven.

66
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:01,749
-Man: Why are they blue?
-Walter: Indeed, I wanted to ask that myself.

67
00:04:01,749 --> 00:04:04,612
Anderson: I have a blue pen with me. This was just a demonstration.

68
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:08,079
Man: That's the problem, your lines are blue. Draw them with red ink.

69
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,057
Anderson: It won't solve the problem.

70
00:04:10,057 --> 00:04:11,999
Walter: Well, how do you know before you've tried?

71
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:13,731
Let's draw them with red ink and then let's see, hmm?

72
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:19,173
Anderson: I don't have a red pen with me. But, um, I'm completely certain that with red ink the result will still be the same.

73
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:22,932
Walter: Didn't you tell us earlier that you could only draw red lines with red ink?

74
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:25,348
In fact, yes, I've written that down here.

75
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,359
And now you want to draw them with blue ink. And you want us to call these red lines?

76
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:33,293
Justine: I think I understand. You're not talking about the color now, right?

77
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:38,095
You're talking about that, um, what do you call it, uh, perpen- perpendic-

78
00:04:38,095 --> 00:04:39,884
Anderson: Perpendicularity! Yes!

79
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:42,340
Man: That's it. Now you've confused everyone.

80
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,050
So what exactly is stopping us from doing this?

81
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,004
Anderson: Geometry.

82
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:48,668
Woman: Just ignore it.

83
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:51,236
Man: We have a task. Seven red lines.

84
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:53,559
It's not twenty. It's just seven.

85
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,317
Anderson, I understand you're a specialist of a narrow field.

86
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:58,199
You don't see the overall picture.

87
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,092
But surely it's not a difficult task to draw some seven lines.

88
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:06,219
Walter: Exactly. Suggest a solution. Any fool can criticize.

89
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:10,214
No offense. But you're an expert. You should know better.

90
00:05:10,636 --> 00:05:15,926
Anderson: Okay. Let me draw you two perfectly perpendicular red lines.

91
00:05:15,926 --> 00:05:20,126
And I will draw the rest with transparent ink.

92
00:05:20,126 --> 00:05:22,499
They'll be invisible, but I'll draw them.

93
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:25,087
Woman: Would this suit us?

94
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:27,540
(Justine nodding)
-Woman: Yes, this will suit us.

95
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,889
Justine: Yes, but at least a couple with green ink. Oh, and I have another question if I may.

96
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:34,266
Can you draw one of the lines in the form of a kitten?

97
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:37,085
-Anderson: Uh, what?
-Justine: In the form of a kitten?

98
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:40,126
Market research tells us our users like cute animals.

99
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:42,424
Justine: It will be really great if we could...
Anderson: No...

100
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:43,759
Justine: But why?

101
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,878
Anderson: Look, I can of course draw you a cat. I'm not artist but I can give it a try.

102
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:49,231
But it won't be a line anymore, it will be a cat.

103
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:51,389
A line and a cat, these are two different things.

104
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:57,911
Woman: A kitten. Not a cat. But a kitten. They're little. Cute. Cuddly.

105
00:05:57,911 --> 00:06:00,294
-Woman: Cats on the other hand are...
-Anderson: It won't make a difference.

106
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:03,836
Walter: Anderson, at least hear her out. She hasn't even finished speaking and you're already saying no.

107
00:06:03,836 --> 00:06:09,765
Anderson: I got the idea. But it's impossible to draw a line in the form of a cat - kitten.

108
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:12,492
Justine: What about a bird?

109
00:06:15,737 --> 00:06:17,588
Man: So where do we stop? What are we doing?

110
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:20,660
Walter: Seven red lines, two with red ink, two with green ink

111
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,452
and the rest with transparent. Did I understand correctly?

112
00:06:23,452 --> 00:06:26,423
-Woman: Yes.
-Man: Excellent. In which case that's everything, right?

113
00:06:26,423 --> 00:06:29,431
Justine: Oh, I almost forgot. We also have a red balloon.

114
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,566
Do you know if you could inflate it?

115
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:37,756
Anderson: What do I have to do with balloons?

116
00:06:37,756 --> 00:06:38,917
Justine: It's red.

117
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:42,370
Man: Anderson, can you or can you not do this? It's a simple question.

118
00:06:42,658 --> 00:06:44,310
Anderson: As such, I can, of course, but -

119
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,944
Man: Excellent. Organize a business trip. We'll cover the expenses,

120
00:06:47,944 --> 00:06:52,690
go over to their location, inflate the balloon.

121
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:56,730
Well, this was very productive. Thank you all.

122
00:06:57,677 --> 00:07:00,752
(Indistinct talking)
(door closes)

123
00:07:06,705 --> 00:07:10,492
(door opens)
Justine: Can I ask you one more question, please?

124
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:15,653
When you inflate the balloon, could you do it in the form of a kitten?

125
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:19,699
Anderson: Of course I can. I can do anything.

126
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:34,242
I can do absolutely anything. I'm an expert.

127
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:34,492
